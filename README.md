•	Used machine learning techniques to find the cause of anomalies on the machine (coding with Python, Docker).<br />
•	Created the profile (correlation network) for the machine, and then determined whether there are causal anomalies based on the changes of these correlations.<br />
•	Used parallelization to reduce computing time.
